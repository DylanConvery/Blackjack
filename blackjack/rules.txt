Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One is a game involving one dealer
and one or more players. To beat the dealer the player must first
not bust(go over 21) and second, either outscore the dealer or 
have the dealer go bust.

Initially the dealer will hand out 2 cards to you and 2 to himself,
one of his being face up and the other, face down. 

If you hold an Ace and a 10 card, you automatically win. Also known 
as a blackjack. If the dealer has an Ace or 10, he will check his 
second card to check for a blackjack. If both you and the dealer 
have a blackjack, it counts as a draw.

The player can draw up to five cards providing he does not exceed 21
so as to get closer to 21. If the dealer has 16 or less in total he
will draw another card. If the dealer goes over 21 and the player
has not gone bust, the player wins!

On the rare chance that a player draws 5 cards without going bust, 
they automatically win, resulting in a five-card Charlie.
