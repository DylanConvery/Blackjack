Cards 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are all worth their face value.

King, Queen, and Jack are all worth 10.

Ace is considered a wild card, if your combined card value is less 
than 21, then ace is worth 11, but in the case where having ace be
worth 11 would result in your combined card value exceeding 21, 
then ace is worth 1.

Suits have no effect in Blackjack.
